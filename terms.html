            <h4>The Crafter Services</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Crafter may make available certain project listings and other project-related contents, including links to third-party websites (such listings
                    and other contents, (“project Listings” or “project Ads”), through Crafter’s search results or otherwise through the App. Project Listings are
                    created and provided by third parties over whom Crafter exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that we have no control
                    over Project Listings. Crafter does not have any obligation to screen any Project Listing, or to include any Project Listing in its search
                    results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Project Listing from the Site for any or no reason. We cannot confirm the accuracy
                    or completeness of any Project Listing or other information submitted by any Project admin or other user, including the identity of such
                    admin or other user. Crafter assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability,
                    or availability of any Project Listing. You agree that Crafter may also provide search options to narrow down Project Listing search results
                    by Project type (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such Project types are created independently and entirely by Crafter, and are not a direct
                    reflection of the actual Project Listing. </li>
                <li>If you are a Project admin, when you create a Crafter account, a Career Page or post a Project Listing on the App, whether as part of the Crafter Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement and all of Crafter’s policies, including the Crafter Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, Join to you and to the Project Seekers using such Career Page or indicating an interest in such Project Listings. Specifically, when you create a Crafter account, Crafter may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called NetVerify. By using NetVerify, you are submitting your identification documents for verification directly to NetVerify, you are agreeing to share your identification with NetVerify, and you agree that NetVerify is solely responsible for any use or loss of data. Crafter may have access to your identification documents via NetVerify. You also agree that, as a service to Project Seekers, Crafter may activate its Crafter Join relay function for use in connection with such Project Listing, and that any Project Seekers who wish to indicate an interest in such Project Listing may only do so through Crafter Join, and that Crafter will send requests to the email address you provide us with. When you use the Crafter Join relay function, you acknowledge and agree that Crafter may add certain functions into the email, which allows you to take actions regarding the Project Seeker including setting up an interview, viewing a portfolio and rejecting a candidate, and that you consent to Crafter monitoring and analyzing these actions. When using the Crafter Join function, Crafter will attempt to send requests to the contact information provided to Crafter by you, the Admin. Crafter has no ability to verify the contact information provided by You. In the event You provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Project Seekers, and you indemnify Crafter for any damages resulting therefrom. In addition, Crafter may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Project Seekers you wish to interview. Crafter may also send emails to Project Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Project Listing is potentially a match for the Project Seeker’s portfolio. Crafter is not responsible for the content of your emails, request form, screener questions or their format, and Crafter does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Project Seeker’s emails or request materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data. When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Crafter to send out rejection notices if the Project Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction. If you choose such option, you agree you are instructing us to send out rejection notices to such candidates and set them to rejected in your Admin dashboard. You further acknowledge that Crafter has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections (which is purely mechanical), that t ransmission is not guaranteed, and that the Project Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately. You agree that Crafter Join is presented to you without warranty and Crafter assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Project Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Project Seekers’ sole responsibility. By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Crafter to send a Project Seeker a telephone number, which the Project Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions. You agree these questions are part of your request process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Crafter. You also agree that you are only asking Crafter to record the Project Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Crafter will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions. You consent to Crafter listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Crafter’s Privacy Policy. When you respond to or contact a Project Seeker who has used Crafter Portfolio, or Crafter Join, you are providing information to Crafter and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Project Seeker. Additionally, you consent to Project Seekers’ requests and any responses sent by you (including offer letters) through Crafter being processed and analyzed by Crafter according to this Agreement and Crafter’s Privacy Policy. Crafter shall store such information regardless of whether a Project vacancy has been filled. You are responsible for the contents of any Career Page that you create, any Project Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Crafter Join or otherwise, including any questions for Project Seekers. You agree that Crafter may reject or remove any Project Listing, any part of any Career Page, or any questions for Project Seekers for any or no reason. You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Crafter, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Career Page created by you, or any Project Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Project Seekers contained in any of the foregoing). Crafter may provide analytics data regarding your Admin account to anyone at your company at Crafter’s discretion. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Crafter product, Crafter reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Crafter product as well as any other Crafter product, including but not limited to those Crafter products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance.</li>
                <li>Regardless of whether you are a Project admin or Project Seeker, when you send, store or receive materials (including Project Listings, portfolios, and messages) through or using the App, Crafter may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the App or any other Crafter product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Project Seekers and Admins), whether via automated means or otherwise. When you send, store or receive materials through or using the App, Crafter may also inform a Project Seeker that a Project admin has taken an action with regards to a Project Seeker’s request such as opening the request, viewing the request and making a decision with regards to the request, and you hereby consent to Crafter taking such actions. Crafter assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, legality, reliability, or availability of any Project listing, Career Page, Project solicitation, screener question, answer to screener question, portfolio information you post, send or receive through the App. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Crafter to do so. Crafter does not promise to correct any inaccuracy.</li>
                <li>Regardless of whether you are a Project admin or Project Seeker, Crafter may use request materials (including portfolios and responses to screener questions) to determine whether the words of any Project Seeker’s portfolio and answers to screener questions match the words of a Project Listing, and vice-versa. Regardless of whether you are a Project admin or Project Seeker, you agree and consent that Crafter may differentiate those matching portfolios and screener questions from those that do not match, and presenting them to Admins as matches or not matches. Crafter may also use such information in order to improve the App or any other Crafter product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Project Listings and portfolios to Project Seekers and Admins).</li>
                <li>Regardless of whether you are a Project admin or Project Seeker, Crafter may use request materials (including portfolios and responses to screener questions) to determine whether the words of any Project Seeker’s portfolio and answers to screener questions match the words of a Project Listing, and vice-versa. Regardless of whether you are a Project admin or Project Seeker, you agree and consent that Crafter may differentiate those matching portfolios and screener questions from those that do not match, and presenting them to Admins as matches or not matches. Crafter may also use such information in order to improve the App or any other Crafter product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Project Listings and portfolios to Project Seekers and Admins).</li>
                <li>Regardless of whether you are a Project admin or Project Seeker, Crafter may provide you an online questionnaire relating to your industry and/or your hiring or Project searching needs. Crafter may match a Project Seeker’s responses to such questionnaires to determine, on the basis of the Admin’s responses to a questionnaire about its industry and/or hiring needs, whether such Project Seeker would match the Admin’s hiring criteria as specified in the Admin’s questionnaire responses. In the event Crafter determines that a Project Seeker matches the Admin’s hiring criteria, Crafter may connect such matching Project Seeker and Admin by sending a note informing both parties of the match, including but not limited to sending a Project admin a short description of a Project Seeker taken directly from the Project Seeker’s responses to the questionnaire. In all events you will know what data we are providing to either a Project Seeker or Admin, or upon which we relied to make the match, because you have actively submitted it. If the Admin and Project Seeker express interest in each other, you agree Crafter may provide the Admin with an email address for the Project Seeker either provided by Crafter or the Project Seeker and, if you are a Project Seeker, you consent to this. Regardless of whether you are a Project admin or Project Seeker, by submitting the completed questionnaire, you agree and consent to Crafter (i) conducting such matching, utilizing only material you have submitted through the questionnaire process, (ii) presenting matching Project Seekers to Admins, and vice versa and (iii) storing and analyzing such data submitted in response to such online questionnaires.</li>
                <li>If you are a Project Seeker, you take a variety of actions on our App. For example, you search for Projects, and Crafter knows and stores the titles of Projects you search for, where those Projects are located, any information, including salary interest or experience of which you have informed Crafter, or the general salary range or experience level of the Projects you view (if indicated on the Project Listings), the Project Listings you Join to, or any of your other behavior on the Crafter App, when you use Crafter. You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity. If you have a Crafter account or an Crafter-hosted portfolio, you agree that Crafter may use this observed factual data to suggest Projects to you and to suggest you or your public portfolio to Admins that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Crafter. You also agree that Crafter may contact you based on this observed behavior. Please note, although information may be sent to you by a third party through the Crafter system, the aforementioned behavior does not include information relayed to you. However, Crafter may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Crafter App or the fact that you have recently used the Crafter system to correspond with a third party.</li>
                <li>The Crafter Express Plan is governed by the terms and conditions found in the Crafter Ads Program terms below, with the exception of any billing terms contained in Section Payment. If you have chosen to activate the Crafter advanced Plan, please note that you will only be charged the amount listed on the Express Plan page in the Post a Project funnel on the App (“Express Plan Page”) if you receive the number of qualified applicants described on the Express Plan Page, in the amount of time listed on the Express Plan Page. A Qualified Applicant is defined as an applicant whose answers to the request questions you configure meet your defined requirements. In order to activate this plan, you must configure at least one request question. Once you have activated an Express Plan, you may pause or cancel your Project at any time. Once you have received the number of Qualified Applicants listed on the Express Plan Page, your Project will be automatically paused. After the amount of time listed on the Express Plan Page has passed, if you reactivate your Project, it will be governed by the entirety of the Crafter Ads Program terms</li>
